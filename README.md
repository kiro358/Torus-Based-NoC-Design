# Torus-Based-NoC-Design

A Specialized 4x4 mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC) with torus topology and wormhole routing, achieving a remarkable 30% improvement in throughput and significant latency reduction. Designed a fault-tolerant routing algorithm tailored for torus-based NoC architectures, ensuring reliable data transmission with over 95% fault recovery rate in simulations. Engineered an energy-efficient NoC architecture with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, demonstrating up to 20% energy savings validated through SystemC simulations.
